Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows you to inject dependencies into a class without the class having to explicitly create them. In Angular, DI is used to manage the lifecycle of objects and provide them to other objects.

Key Benefits of DI in Angular:

Testability: Makes testing easier by allowing you to mock dependencies.
Modularity: Promotes modularity by breaking down components into smaller, reusable parts.
Maintainability: Makes code more maintainable by reducing coupling between components.
Flexibility: Allows you to easily change the implementation of a dependency without affecting the consumer.
How it Works in Angular:

Provider: Defines how to create an object.
Injector: Responsible for creating and managing objects.
Consumer: The class that requires the dependency.

// HeroService.ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class HeroService {
  getHero() {
    // ...
  }
}

// HeroComponent.ts
@Component({
  // ...
})
export class HeroComponent {
  constructor(private heroService: HeroService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.hero = this.heroService.getHero();
  }
}
