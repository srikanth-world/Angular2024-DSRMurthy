Change Detection in Angular

Angular's change detection mechanism is responsible for keeping the view in sync with the model. It detects changes in data and updates the DOM accordingly.

Key Points:

Default Strategy: Checks all components for changes in every cycle.
OnPush Strategy: More efficient, checks only when input properties change, child components emit events, or markForCheck() is called.
Optimizing Change Detection:
Use OnPush strategy judiciously.
Minimize unnecessary changes to component properties.
Use immutable data structures.
Leverage RxJS operators for efficient data streams.
By understanding and optimizing change detection, you can build high-performance Angular applications.
